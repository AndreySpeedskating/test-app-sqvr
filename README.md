##Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
Before starting you need to execute the command `yarn` or `npm install`  

##Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:  
`yarn start` or `npm start`  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

##Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

use `yarn buid` or `npm build`  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!
